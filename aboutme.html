    <br>
    <p>Hello! I'm <bold> Sunanda Mishra </bold>, an engineering student at <strong>MIT Manipal</strong> pursuing a Computer Science and Engineering degree. I am deeply passionate about <strong>AI and technology for India</strong>, aiming to create solutions that help not just urban populations, but also people living in Tier 3 villages.</p>

    <p>I love exploring creative projects, learning programming and AI from scratch, and applying my knowledge to real-world problems. I enjoy designing websites, working with code, and building innovative tools that can make life easier for people.</p>

    <p>In addition to technology, I enjoy reflecting on human emotions, metaphysical ideas, and life philosophies. I often weave creativity and personal experiences into projects, making them unique and meaningful.</p>
